## How to use

To use this repository for making Shopify themes, use the following command of Shopify CLI.
```sh
shopify theme init [ NAME OF YOUR THEME ] --clone-url https://github.com/polidario/Elizabeth_Clean
```

I use 2 terminal windows to run npm scripts I’ve added to package.json.
```sh
npm run dev: This runs our Vite configuration and watches for changes. vite is responsible for transpiling the ts into js (assets folder)

npm run shopify: This spins up your dev server for your Shopify theme. Be sure to replace the —store flag with your Shopify store.
```

Note* The SRC folder cannot handle nested files at present, I will need to improve the transpilation process

Note** If you run into crlf errors, use the following command git config —global core.autocrlf false

If you don't have Shopify CLI installed to your computer, navigate to the [installation page of Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/installation).
